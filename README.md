# NeuralTabGenerator
  Neural Tab Generator is a program designed to generate Guitar Pro Tablature files in .gp5 format from MIDI files. It utilizes a pre-trained pyTorch model, which was trained on classical guitar compositions obtained from http://www.classclef.com.

The project was created for Bachelor of Engineering thesis in Acoustic Engineering at AGH University of Science and Technology.

Usage:

1. Load a MIDI file of your song
2. Click generate button and Assign desired generation options
3. Save the generated tablature file

Currently, only E Standard tuning pieces are supported.
